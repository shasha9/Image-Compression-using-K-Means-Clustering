# Image-Compression-using-K-Means-Clustering
This project focuses on applying the k-means clustering unsupervised learning algorithm using scikit-learn and Python to build an image compression application with interactive controls.This project consists of pre-processing high-resolution image data for k-means clustering, conducting basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization, applying a computationally time-efficient implementation of the k-means algorithm, Mini-Batch K-Means, to compress images, and leveraging the Jupyter widgets library to build interactive GUI components to select images from a drop-down list and pick values of k using a slider.
